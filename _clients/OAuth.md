<p>An up-and-coming SaaS/hardware startup was looking to do their first integration with a major (major!) software company, and needed to manage their users’ ability to authorize access to their devices. Specifically, they were told they would need to have a full OAuth implementation for this, and they had no in-house expertise… and no time to grow it!</p>

<p>With my background in OAuth and shepherding inter-company integrations, I was able to help align what needed to be done by each company in order to get the job done right the first time. This involved consulting with both parties on the various OAuth profiles (such as Client Credentials vs. Authorization Code) and work with them to understand the OAuth Specifications to guide them in the right direction. When everyone was in-sync, I also did the actual implementation… naturally in the language they were already using for their stack.</p>
