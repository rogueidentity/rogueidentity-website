<p>I’ve worked with extremely large organizations to help them define their Identity and Access Management solutions. In the case of one regional cable provider, I was brought on when it came to light that their current solution just was not scaling, and wasn’t as secure as it should be.</p>

<p>I took the time to work with them at an architectural and conceptual level. We broke down different options with regard to user datastores, and the secure mechanisms by which we could access user data to make authentication and authorization decisions. The bulk of the implementation was done by me, with coordination with their existing staff and plentiful documentation and unit and integration testing. One of my core philosophies is that the work I do should help your company meet its short term needs, but also leave you in a place where you can expand and extend on the new functionality we create together.</p>
