<p>Over the course of my career I’ve had several occasions in which to implement OpenID Connect, both as the Relying Party and the OpenID Provider. Using this protocol makes it possible to integrate with any number of standards-based organizations – which is especially beneficial when doing social-login scenarios.</p>

<p>With OIDC, as with other protocols such as SAML and OAuth, much of the challenge is with knowing what is important for your particular use case, and what is not. That’s where bringing in someone with expertise and experience in implementation is extremely valuable and time-effective. My approach is to help you and your organization understand what needs to be done, to help implement it for you, and to leave you with the tools and knowledge to build more when the time comes.</p>
