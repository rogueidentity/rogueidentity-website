**I hate not understanding something.**

Ok, that’s not completely true. I don’t care if I don’t understand something I don’t care about. It doesn’t bother me that I don’t know about Australian politics, or stir fry cooking. Some things I even take perverse pleasure in knowing nothing about, like the Kardashians, or “Gawker Media".

But I do hate not knowing about something that is important to me, something that I *should* know about. As a founder, one thing I should know more about is "Marketing Technology" or "martech." We’re adherents to the “Lean” style of entrepreneurship, and we want to have all the data we can get to help guide us in building this business. So I need to know more — lots more — about the tools available and how they work. 

This blog is all about that learning process, as I grow from my current state of “don’t know shit” to (hopefully) “pretty ok with this marketing technology stuff.” Feel free to reach out (topher@rogueidentity.com), point me in the right direction, argue with faulty assertions, and laugh at my mistakes.
