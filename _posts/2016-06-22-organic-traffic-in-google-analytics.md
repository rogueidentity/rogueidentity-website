I've mentioned that this site is just starting, right? Because the following is a bit embarrassing.

<div class="row">
	<div class="small-8 large-8 columns">
		<img src="{{site.url}}/images/ga/one_visitor.png"/>
	</div>
</div>
<br/>
Yeah, one visitor. That visitor actually did go to the contact page -- which is [how I set up my goal]({% post_url 2016-06-17-view-filter-ga %}) -- but I misconfigured the goal so it didn't register as a 'conversion.' At least the [filter]({% post_url 2016-06-17-view-filter-ga %}) is working, and I didn't see any traffic from my home IP.

Again, I can't feel too bad yet. This site is linked to by exactly two places. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tophermarie) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/topher_marie) accounts.

Interestingly, though, this visitor came in via organic search, according to Google Analytics. I wish I knew what the visitor was looking for, but apparently it's impossible to determine [what search terms were used to find your site in organic traffic](http://searchengineland.com/google-puts-a-price-on-privacy-98029). Unless you use paid search. Maybe I should do some more investigation into that area. But the **(not provided)** is certainly a hinderance to developing content your visitors want to see.

Coming soon in this series... how to improve SEO. Gotta start pulling in some more views if we're going to see what works and what doesn't.
