I'd like to get a daily report emailed to me automatically from Google Analytics. The more easily and consistently I get the data and act upon it, the better.

After preparing the report I'd like to see -- which in this case, is Goal Completions in the last seven days -- I click on the 'Email' button in the top right.

<div class="row">
	<div class="small-8 large-8 columns">
		<img src="{{site.url}}/images/ga/goal_report.png"/>
	</div>
</div>

(Again, let's not get wrapped up in the site's low volume quite yet...)

I configured the subject line of the email, and set it to run daily. Also, I chose PDF as the attachment type - otherwise you don't get the pretty graph, but rather a raw database file of the information.
<div class="row">
	<div class="small-8 large-8 columns">
		<img src="{{site.url}}/images/ga/configure_email.png"/>
	</div>
</div>

Success, a Google Analytics report email sent straight to my inbox.

<div class="row">
	<div class="small-8 large-8 columns">
		<img src="{{site.url}}/images/ga/goal_report_email.png"/>
	</div>
</div>
